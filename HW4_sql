-- Question 1: What are the average values of metal ores, fossil fuels, and minerals from our dataset (1970-2017)?
SELECT AVG(metal_ores_tonnes) from homework3_schema.us_resources;
SELECT AVG(fossil_fuels_tonnes) from homework3_schema.us_resources;
SELECT AVG(minerals_tonnes) from homework3_schema.us_resources;

-- Question 2: What is the maximum of metal ores, fossil fuels, and minerals during this time period?
SELECT MAX(metal_ores_tonnes) from homework3_schema.us_resources;
SELECT MAX(fossil_fuels_tonnes) from homework3_schema.us_resources;
